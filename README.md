fGrid is a responsive and customisable grid system for SASS styled websites. It's built to be flexible and small and is suitable for a wide range of projects.

Please Note: We're currently specifying and building fGrid, docs are sparse and there's probably some nasty bugs. If you spot issues please report them!

See http://fgrid.fullaf.com for more details.
