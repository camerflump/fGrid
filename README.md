fGrid is a responsive and customisable grid system for Sass styled websites. It's built to be flexible and small and is suitable for a wide range of projects.

Please Note: We're currently specifying and building fGrid, docs are sparse and there's probably some nasty bugs. If you spot issues please report them!

See http://fgrid.fullaf.com for more details.

## Dependencies
Some of the fancy bits of fGrid need [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), and frankly if you're using fGrid you should use Bourbon, it's awesome!

Ensure Bourbon is included in your Sass files before fGrid and everything should work.

## Install

The easiest way to get fGrid is with [Bower](http://bower.io/), simply run `bower install fgrid` in your project directory and add `@import "bower_components/fgrid/fgrid"` below your bourbon include line.

## Testing

fGrid testing comprises installing dependencies and compiling the project to ensure building is successful. We use Travis for this.
